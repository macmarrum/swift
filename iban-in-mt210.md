The SWIFT MT210 message is a "Notice to Receive." It's sent by a financial institution (the "receiver" of the message) to its correspondent to inform them that it expects to receive funds to a specific account.

Given its purpose, the primary field in an MT210 that can contain an IBAN is:

1.  **Field 25: Account Identification**
    * This is an **optional** field.
    * It identifies the account to be credited with the incoming funds at the institution receiving the MT210 message.
    * This field is particularly relevant when the Receiver (of the MT210) services more than one account for the Sender (of the expected funds).
    * It can contain either an IBAN (International Bank Account Number) or any proprietary (bank-specific) identification. The format allows for a 35-character alphanumeric string, which is sufficient for an IBAN.

While other fields might contain BICs (like 50a Ordering Customer, 52a Ordering Institution, 56a Intermediary), their primary role is to identify the *institutions* involved in the underlying transaction, not necessarily specific account numbers *at those institutions* within the context of an MT210.

The MT210 is a notification message, so its focus is on the expected credit to a specific account. Therefore, **Field 25** is the key location for an IBAN in an MT210.
